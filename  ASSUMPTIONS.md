### Assume that:

0. No more than 3 working days are used to develop the system.
1. I am familiar with concepts I used here, but also feel more comfortable with Codeigniter than Laravel.
2. This is *minimal demo purpose only* system so, not all parts of project are developed as designed previously.
3. There is a lot of room for improvements and optimizations, which we can talk more in deep
   if I am invited for technical discussion.

*Thank you for reading.*
